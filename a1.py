MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
I’m learning Python basics in a high school programming class, but I’m having problems understanding my teacher. I have experience in Java,  as a python tutor can you create 5-7 practice problems that get more challenging as they progress? You can utilize my intermediate java experience to make references that I can catch onto for these problems. Please ensure that these practice problems include 
Variables and basic data types 
Conditionals (if/elif/else) 
Loops (for and while) 
Functions 
Basic list operations 
Clear instructions 
Example inputs/ outputs 
Nice visuals

# PART 2: AI-GENERATED PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS
# =============================================================================

"""
PROBLEM 1: Variable Basics — “Hello, Python!”
Concepts: Variables, strings, integers, basic printing 
Java Parallel: System.out.println, primitive types

Example:
Problem: Write a function called 'is_even' that takes an integer and returns 
True if the number is even, False if it's odd.

Example inputs/outputs:
- is_even(4) should return True
- is_even(7) should return False


PROBLEM 2: Conditional Logic — “Even or Odd?”
Concepts: if/elif/else, modulo operator 
Java Parallel: if-else, % operator

Example: Write a function check_even_odd(num) that prints whether a number is even or odd.

check_even_odd(7)
# Output:
7 is odd

check_even_odd(12)
# Output:
12 is even

Python uses indentation instead of {} for blocks.

PROBLEM 3: Looping — “Countdown Timer”
Concepts: for loop, range() 
Java Parallel: for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--)

Example: Write a program that counts down from a given number to 0.

start = 5
# Output:
5
4
3
2
1
0



PROBLEM 4: While Loop — “Password Checker”

Concepts: while loop, conditionals
Java Parallel: while (!valid)

Example: Keep asking the user to enter the password until they type "python123".

Enter password: java123
Incorrect password. Try again.
Enter password: python123
Access granted.





PROBLEM 5: Functions — “Simple Calculator”

Concepts: Functions, parameters, return values
Java Parallel: public static int add(int a, int b)

    Example: Create a function calculator(a, b, operation) that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

calculator(10, 5, "add")
# Output: 15

calculator(10, 5, "divide")
# Output: 2.0
    



PROBLEM 6: Lists — “Grade Analyzer”

Concepts: Lists, loops, conditionals 
Java Parallel: ArrayList<Integer> grades

    Example: Given a list of grades, print how many are passing (≥ 60).

    grades = [85, 42, 77, 59, 90]
# Output:
3 students passed.


PROBLEM 7: Combined Challenge — “Student Report Generator”

Concepts: Lists, functions, conditionals, loops 
Java Parallel: Combining methods, loops, and arrays

    Example: Write a function generate_report(names, scores) that prints each student’s name, score, and pass/fail status.

names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
scores = [88, 45, 67]

# Output:
Alice: 88 - Pass
Bob: 45 - Fail
Charlie: 67 - Pass

# PART 3: TESTING YOUR SOLUTIONS
# =============================================================================


"""
Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable

Example:
print("Testing Problem 1:")
print(f"is_even(4): {is_even(4)}")  # Should print True
print(f"is_even(7): {is_even(7)}")  # Should print False
"""
