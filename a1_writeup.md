# Assignment 1 - Write UP
Sanyah Bovan
## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

    My initial experience with python was a bit confusing because it seems as though "less is more", while I like java because it has more things written out (hopefully that makes sense). I feel as though the simplistic language of Python is in fact so simple that it doesn't make sense.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

I used AI effectively by asking it to tie the new python lessons to java references that I can understand, and I asked to see a visual of how it would look to code in python. I think the references helped me memorize the python functions more efficiently, but not quite how to code it. In my prompt I gave the AI the role of a python tutor to a student that has intermediate understanding of java. By giving AI a role, the AI understands what is needed from them.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
I think my biggest challenge wasn't the concepts, but instead how to memorize the patterns of coding within Python. I don't believe that AI will help me with memorization of the patterns engraved in  python, so it's mostly user error and in my hands.


4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?

I learned that
